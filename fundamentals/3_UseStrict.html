    <!--I could copy the explanation below, but the guide I'm using explanes it very clearly
    https://javascript.info/strict-mode
    In summary, to enable the strict mode, which shows modificacions done to the language after ECMAScript 5 appeared in 2009,
    we need to explicitly add the "use strict" statement at the beginning of the script.-->

    <script>
      "use strict";

      //the code here works in the modern way
    </script>

    <script>
      alert("some code");
      // "use strict" below is ignored, it must be at the top

      ("use strict");
      // strict mode is not activated
    </script>

    <!--Additionally, the strict mode cannot be cancelled once it is activated-->
  </body>
