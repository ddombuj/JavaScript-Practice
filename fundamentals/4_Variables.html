      /*When naming a variable there are three limitations on variable names in JavaScript:
            1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
            2. The first character must not be a digit.
            3. The name cannot be a reserved word. */

      /*Variables are created when you assign a value to them in no "use strict" mode. 
      You can also reassign them later.*/
      num = 5; //It is correct here

      //In strict mode, it will give an error
      /*
      "use strict";
      num1 = 5; Error: num1 is not defined

      //Constants
      //To declare a constant, "const" is used instead of "let"
      const myName = "Diego";
